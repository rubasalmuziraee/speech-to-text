# **Speech to Text Using ESP32 WASDOM PIECE**

## **Overview**
This project demonstrates the use of the **ESP32 WASDOM PIECE** to implement a **Speech to Text** functionality. The goal is to convert spoken language into text using the ESP32 microcontroller and integrate it with available speech recognition software. This tool can be applied to a variety of real-time applications where speech-to-text conversion is required, such as virtual assistants, voice commands, or accessibility tools.

## **Steps to Operate the ESP32 WASDOM PIECE**

To successfully operate the **ESP32 WASDOM PIECE** and enable the speech-to-text conversion, follow these steps:

### **1. Hardware Requirements**
- **ESP32 Development Board**
- **Microphone Module** compatible with ESP32
- **Power Source** for the ESP32 (e.g., USB power or battery pack)

### **2. Software Requirements**
- **Arduino IDE** (or any other compatible IDE for ESP32 development)
- **ESP32 Board Library** for Arduino IDE
- **Speech Recognition Library** (e.g., Google Speech API, PocketSphinx, etc.)

### **3. Connecting the ESP32 WASDOM PIECE**
1. Connect the **Microphone Module** to the ESP32 development board.
2. Ensure proper wiring (check the datasheet or documentation for pinout specifics).

### **4. Software Setup**
1. Open the **Arduino IDE**.
2. Install the **ESP32 board library**.
3. Install the **Speech Recognition Library** (Google Speech or similar).
4. Upload the provided code to the ESP32 board via the IDE.
5. Set up the appropriate libraries and configurations for speech recognition.

### **5. Operation**
- After uploading the code, power on the ESP32.
- The device will begin listening for audio input through the connected microphone.
- The ESP32 will process the speech input and convert it into text.
- The recognized text will be output to the serial monitor or another display interface.

### **6. Testing**
- Speak into the microphone and check the serial monitor for real-time speech-to-text conversion.
- Adjust the microphone sensitivity if necessary to improve the recognition accuracy.

## **Technology Stack**
- **ESP32** Microcontroller
- **Arduino IDE**
- **Speech Recognition Software** (Google Speech, PocketSphinx, etc.)
